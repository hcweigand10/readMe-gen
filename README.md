## Description

![badgeImg](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

This application can be used generate README's for coding projects in markdown. I created this in order to save time and ensure that all of my READMEs going forward are of high quality. The generation of the README follows the template file marked "template.md" and fills in the sections with answers from the user.
